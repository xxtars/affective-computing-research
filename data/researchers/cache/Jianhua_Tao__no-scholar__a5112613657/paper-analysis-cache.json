      "reason": "The paper directly addresses sentiment analysis—a core affective/emotion-related task—and explicitly aligns with Jianhua Tao's interest in 'emotion' through multimodal modeling of affective states, supervised contrastive learning for emotion-labeled data, and hierarchical fusion designed for affective understanding.",

        "Title includes 'Multimodal Sentiment Analysis'",
        "Abstract states the goal is 'comprehensive understanding of sentiment' and uses emotion-labeled datasets (CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS)",
        "Uses supervised contrastive learning (SCL) leveraging label information—commonly emotion/sentiment labels in these benchmarks"
